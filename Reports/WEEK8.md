* And also, colors were chosen for the text, for the icon and elements. For the right choice of color, I read articles from the site, it is for educational sites that colors are more suitable and additionally analyzed the SDU site. While analyzing, I noticed that on the SDU website they chose a dark red color for the accent and used them for the icons, for the main subtitles. And in the end I decided to take a dark blue color for the text and a dark red color for the important subheading elements. Since the blue color makes the site discreet, serious, conveys a sense of trust to the visitor, and this color is also very popular in design. And dark red colors are associated with importance and youth and attract the user's attention. And also this color is more suitable for minimalistic sites.
