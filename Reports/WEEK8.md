This week I held a meeting with the team, prioritized the tasks and drew conclusions on the previous tasks. We discussed with the backend developer the functional part of registering students for courses, as well as how exactly we will organize a blog on our website.

A small part of the discussion was user registration. User confirmation information. Since our site will initially be available only to SDU students, registration will only take place by SDU mail.

In week 8, I created methods for teachers where the teacher (Assistant) can see the current course. And how many students are registered. You can also see other details such as the time and information about this course. Before creating methods and queries, I created a postgresql architecture for courses for teachers. The table is called teacher_course, at the moment there are several columns(id, course_name, course_info, course_time, assistent_id ).

* In the 8th week, I was busy with the corrections, and also drew the Assistant Profile page. Here I added the same sections as the Student section, and additionally, the Work Experience section was added. And also in the sections My courses, My library there is a function that is performed through the Add button. And also, respectively, blank pages were drawn for each section.

* And also, colors were chosen for the text, for the icon and elements. For the right choice of color, I read articles from the site, it is for educational sites that colors are more suitable and additionally analyzed the SDU site. While analyzing, I noticed that on the SDU website they chose a dark red color for the accent and used them for the icons, for the main subtitles. And in the end I decided to take a dark blue color for the text and a dark red color for the important subheading elements. Since the blue color makes the site discreet, serious, conveys a sense of trust to the visitor, and this color is also very popular in design. And dark red colors are associated with importance and youth and attract the user's attention. And also this color is more suitable for minimalistic sites.
