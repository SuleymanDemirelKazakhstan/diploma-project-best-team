In week 5, according to the plan, I had to “Create a clear MindMap for myself, taking into account the detailed elements and information of each page to visualize how everything will work. And start drawing a High-fidelity wireframe for the Student pages.”
First of all in the Miro platform, I created a MindMap starting from the main page.

Further, according to this scheme, I began to draw the Home page, which is divided into 5 blocks. After completing the Home page, I proceeded to the Header functions, or rather to the “Find an Assistant” page, where we can see all the assistants and their courses in the form of a card, and also do a search. And after that, I drew the Login page, and all its states when entering, on error.
And while drawing pages, I collected components in a UI-kit (icons, fields, footer, header, buttons, cards). As planned in previous weeks, while studying similar pages, I noted and took a screenshot of the necessary, suitable moments, and also used them in my work.
