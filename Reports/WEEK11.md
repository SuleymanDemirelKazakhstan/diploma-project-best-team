At week 11, I checked the work of the team, set tasks for the coming week.
According to the plan, this week we have to finish work on the modules "Find an assistant", "Student profile", "Student profile".
Also this week, we discussed the structure of the administrator page, which will check the requests of assistants.

In week 11, I created a method for student profile that will edit student data. Students can change their data such as first name, last name, phone number, etc. To create an editing method, you first need to link 2 tables such as user and student.

On the 11th week I worked with the Admin part. We discussed with the team all the points with this part, what pages, data will be, how it will work. And during the discussion, I made a Mindmap for the admin part, so that it would be convenient and understandable to work.

And then I got to work. Based on this structure, I began to draw pages, namely the Login page, the Main page, the User page and the Application Page. I made the Login page simple, without unnecessary clicks and functions, but simply with entering the login and password fields. And we decided to add two sections to the Main page - Users and Applications, where Users include Assistants and Students. Since the admin part will see the same user data. And on the Application page, the main information (name and surname, mail and profile picture) of the student who submitted the application will first be displayed. A detailed questionnaire will appear on the modal window.
