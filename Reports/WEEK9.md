# Kairolla Nurkhan (Project manager)
* This week I checked the work of the team. Set goals for the next week.
* Slightly changed the structure when entering the site. Initially, it was planned that our site would be similar to the SDU portal, that is, when we enter, we will be immediately greeted by Login / Signup. It was decided to make it so that the user first went to our site, got acquainted with the available courses, and then registered if desired.

# Samarkhan Shyngys (Backend developer)
When we are doing our local project and we need to receive requests from external services during integration.
Because, the developer of the front has to make requests while in another place.
For these cases, we can use the services of creating tunnels to our computer. One of the popular services for building tunnels to your computer is ngrok. It is insanely simple and at the same time functional in the free version.
