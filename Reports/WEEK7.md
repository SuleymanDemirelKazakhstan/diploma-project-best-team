This week I started working on the project documentation. I checked the work of the team, and outlined the tasks for the next week. We worked out some moments with the designer and front-end developer.

* According to the plan, I had to finish all the pages from the side of the entrance of the Student. Below I will describe each page that was added.
“Course details” page. On this page, the course is described, as well as about the teacher, his education, work experience and certificates are provided, and on the side you can immediately sign up for courses, choosing a convenient time from the available ones. All of these provided information is filled in when creating a course from an assistant, as well as during registration. After recording, we get a modal window about the successful process. And also there is an opportunity to send a message, if necessary.

* The next page is the Profile. We can make a transition to this page, where after clicking on the avatar, a drop down with several sections appears. On the profile page, we can make changes to all input fields except for the SDU email address. Why did we add a phone number? In addition to the email address, there should be another way to contact the student. And then I drew pages for each section - My courses, My books, Favorites, Settings.

* And after that, I showed the state of how the dropdown notification will look like. Here you will see a notification about the confirmation of the application from the Admin, a reminder about the beginning of the lesson, as well as a notification about adding to the general chat from the assistant.

* Next, I showed the Message page. And also the option where there is no message. Here, in addition to personal chats, there will also be group chats, where only assistants can create for their classes if necessary.

* And also, having finished all the main pages, according to the plan, I had to proceed with the part of the Assistant. First, I created the Landing page “Become an assistant”, where we will have 3 blocks. These blocks describe how it will work, and also in one block, the user is called to action to become an assistant. To do this, you will need to fill out a questionnaire and, accordingly, I must draw a page for filling out the questionnaire. To get started, I first tested the teacher part of the Preply site, or rather filled out the questionnaire step by step to submit the application.

Thus, I compiled my method of filling out the questionnaire, and I got 4 steps, which are the most necessary. These are Personal Data, Work Experience, Certificates and Videos to increase the credibility of the assistant.
