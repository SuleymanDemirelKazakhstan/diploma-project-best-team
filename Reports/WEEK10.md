In week 10, I created methods for the library that will display books. Teachers can upload their books for students. The library is available to all users and
each of them can download or save it to themselves. In the future, the library will have a section for the faculty and also for subjects. This gives the advantage of quickly and easily finding the necessary book.

# Kalzhanova Zhansaule (UI/UX designer)
And also this prototype was tested on team members. On the 10th week, missed moments were noted and corrected, as well as moments where it would be necessary to supplement. According to the participants, there was one inconvenient moment before login/registering. According to the initial architecture of the site, we decided that we would first log in and then go to the main page, as well as access to the rest of the information. After correcting this moment, the architecture of the site changed at the initial stage. It was decided that the main page would open first, information (courses, library) would be available, and if the user then wanted to take an action (sign up, go to a profile, download a book, become an assistant), then they would need to sign in, or rather, there would be a transition to the login/registration page.
And also fixed missing points, such as input dropdowns, input error on the login/registration and profile pages.

Also continued to write components. Some examples are below. Also I have made some interactions to switch pages. And in library it has been able to change by left and right buttons.
